# :car: AR Racing Game
A game originally built in AR Foundation to demonstrate how to create an AR racing game with AR Meshing LiDAR. This game now works with [Lightship ARDK](https://lightship.dev/products/ardk/) and [AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.2/manual/index.html) and there're two scenes available in this project for each technology.

:pushpin: Take a look at my [YouTube AR Racing Game Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2bpIXzwcWA&list=PLQMQNmwN3FvzKF1Yycc1WtpHrooTLPjDR) to understand this project.
